Project Title: SMBI Earthworks (owned by Family-Tree-Services) providing earth moving, excavating and stump hole drilling services for Russell Island and Redland Bay area of South East QLD, Australia.
Project Description: A static web page with a scrolling carousel banner showing 3 images showcasing what the company does; i.e. tree lopping, tree stump removal, and green waste removal. I decided on a static
                     website as the client had requested a simple website to highlight the basic services his business provides. I used images liberally throughout the web site to capture the viewers' attention and
                     to give a visual representation of services offered. 
Project Challenges:  The website works well, but some minor issues, such as making the images within the carousel clearly visible in their entirety on mobile devices, which didn't quite scale down completely when
                     tested on mobile devices . A couple of links which I overlooked needed tweeking to make them active.
Project Plans:       I hope to add JavaScript dynamism to the website later if the customer wishes to make it more interactive for the customer.
